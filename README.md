### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Angelo. I'm a freelance Management Consultant, Lead BA/PM and self-taught Data Scientist. 

My core experience comes from working in large enterprize technology projects in banks, data vendors, consultancies or the public sector, implementing Data Analytics solutions, Digital Transformation and Technology Change. 

My involvement in Data Science goes back to 2019 when I started learning Python (I did go down the R vs Python existential yes, and guess what :P ), Statistics and Machine Learning, building small projects and honing my skills.

This unique blend of soft and technical skills is my sweet spot; it allows me to bridge the gap between the Business and Analytics teams and switch gears working with both as required in order to bring critical projects over the line and deliver great value to my Clients.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Fraud Analytics for the Insurance Industry and also building my personal website ðŸ’¥
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git, Python Software Engineering and Crypto 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects within the Analytics space
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my Software Engineering skills (I'm still learning)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: I'm a father of two boys, come from Greece, but live in London
