### Hi there 👋
👉 My name is Angelo. I'm originally from Greece, but live and work in London.
  
👉 I'm a freelance Management Consultant, Lead BA/PM and self-taught Data Scientist. 

👉 My core experience comes from working in large enterprize technology projects in banks(🏛), data vendors(📊), consultancies or the public sector, implementing Data Analytics solutions, Digital Transformation and Technology Change. 

👉 My involvement in Data Science goes back to 2019 when I started learning Python (I did go down the R vs Python existential yes, and guess what :P ), Statistics and Machine Learning, building small projects and honing my skills.

👉This unique blend of soft and technical skills is my sweet spot: it allows me to bridge the gap (⚖) between the Business and Analytics teams, switch gears as required in order to bring critical projects over the line and deliver great value to my Clients!
